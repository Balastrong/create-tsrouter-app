- Clone the repo
  - `gh repo clone TanStack/create-tsrouter-app`
- Ensure `node` is installed
  - https://nodejs.org/en/
- Ensure `pnpm` is installed
  - https://pnpm.io/installation
  - Why? We use `pnpm` to manage workspace dependencies. It's easily the best monorepo/workspace experience available as of when this was written.
- Install dependencies
  - `pnpm install`
  - This installs dependencies for all of the packages in the monorepo, even examples!
  - Dependencies inside of the packages and examples are automatically linked together as local/dynamic dependencies.
- Run the build
  - `pnpm build`
- Build an example app with the builder:
  - `node [root of the monorepo]/cli/create-tsrouter-app/dist/index.js app-js`
  - Do not attempt to build an app within the monorepo because the dependencies will be hoisted into the monorepo.
- Run `pnpm dev` at that top level to build everything in watch mode
- Run `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` to make sure the changes work
- Check your work and PR
